# :ledger: CSE-217 Data Structures Laboratory
> Data Structures Laboratory programs in C++/C prgramming language of CSE-217 (Winter 2017). This repository contains programs of various introductory data structures implemented in C/C++ programming language tested on gcc (linux). It also contains screenshots of operational windows in Ubuntu 17.04 (For usage). 

## How to run a C/C++ program using make in terminal (Linux)?

Extract the master branch in home directory. Open terminal and type in the code there. Let's say merge sort which is named as mergesort in directory Sources/Submission%203/Sorting/Merge%20sort/.

```cd ./Sources/Submission%203/Sorting/Merge%20sort/```

```make mergesort```

```./mergesort```
